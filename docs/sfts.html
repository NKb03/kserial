<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<h3 id="aims-of-sfts">Aims of SFTS</h3>
<ul>
    <li>SFTS is a binary format
        <ul>
            <li>this has speed and size advantages against human-readable formats</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>SFTS doesn’t serialize field names or any other metadata associated with a structure except its type
        <ul>
            <li>this also keeps the serialized size minimal</li>
            <li>field names are normally unnecessary information</li>
            <li>Eventual drawback: the order of field access is important</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>SFTS does caching
        <ul>
            <li>That means that when an object is written two times the second time just a reference back to the first
                structure is written
            </li>
            <li>Also has the advantage that recursive structures are not a problem</li>
            <li>Caching can be disabled</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Low overhead for primitive data types
        <ul>
            <li>Just one byte is wasted for type information per primitive written</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Last but not least: Good error messages and safety
        <ul>
            <li>Where necessary SFTS allows storing type information to intercept errors very early and to give good
                error messages
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="legitimacy-and-comparison-to-other-formats">Legitimacy and Comparison to other Formats</h3>
<h4 id="human-readable-formats-like-json">Human readable formats like JSON</h4>
<ul>
    <li>In comparison to JSON and other non-binary formats sfts has a clear advantage in both performance and serialized
        size TODO(why)
    </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="binary-formats-like-the-java-serialization-format">Binary formats like the Java Serialization format</h4>
<ul>
    <li>SFTS beats the standard Java Serialization in both performance and serialized size, because Java has to write
        all class information to ensure compatibility.
    </li>
    <li>Another major advantage over the Java Serialization is SFTS’s platform independence, as it does not rely on
        classes.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-format">The format</h2>
<p>Each value written to a sfts file has a prefix or header, which is exactly one byte.</p>
<h3 id="primitives">Primitives</h3>
<p>Primitive values are scalars of one of the following types:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Booleans (true and false) with size of one byte</li>
    <li>Bytes in range -128 to 127 with size of one byte</li>
    <li>Chars in range 0 to 2^16 with size of two bytes</li>
    <li>Shorts in range -2^15 to 2^15 - 1 with size of two bytes</li>
    <li>Integers in range -2^31 to 2^31 - 1 with size of four bytes</li>
    <li>Long Integers in range -2^63 to 2^63 - 1 with a size of eight bytes</li>
    <li>Floating point numbers implementing the IEEE 754 standard with a size of four bytes</li>
    <li>Double precision integers with a size of eight bytes</li>
    <li>Strings</li>
</ul>
<p>The prefix for primitive values is a negative byte. After that prefix just the value of the primitive is written
    (except for booleans). - Bytes have the prefix -1 - The Boolean value <code>true</code> is just a -2 - The boolean
    value <code>false</code> is written as a -3 - Shorts have the prefix -4 - Chars have the prefix -5 - Ints have the
    prefix -6 - Longs have the prefix -7 - Floats have the prefix -8 - Doubles have the prefix -9 - Strings have the
    prefix -10</p>
<h4 id="on-strings">On Strings</h4>
<p>Strings are treated specially. They are primitives because their prefix is negative. After this prefix the size of
    the String is written followed by all characters in their exact order (without the character prefix).</p>
<h4 id="why-primitives-have-prefixes">Why primitives have prefixes</h4>
<p>It may seem unnecessary for primitives to have prefixes as the caller normally knows which kind of primitive he wants
    to read. But the advantage of writing prefixes is safety and greatly improved error messages. When somebody writes
    an integer to a stream and actually reads a long, without prefixes what’s happening would be that a cryptic error
    occurs saying that the end of the file has been reached. With prefixes this isn’t the case as the caller gets the
    error message that he tried to read a long where a int was written. Also this fail-fast behaviour prevents state
    from being silently corrupted because of falsely deserialized structures.</p>
<h3 id="structures">Structures</h3>
<h4 id="ids">Id’s</h4>
<p>Id’s are used to identify shared objects that can be shared and referenced by this id. Id’s are written as 32-bit
    signed integers and have no integer prefix.</p>
<p>Structures have a non-negative byte prefix which is divided in multiple bit-flags.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The first bit of structure headers is always 0 because otherwise the value was negative and so denoted a
        primitive header
    </li>
    <li>The second bit is the “null-bit”</li>
    <li>The third bit is the “ref-bit”</li>
    <li>The fourth bit is the “share-bit”</li>
    <li>The fifth bit is the “untyped-bit”</li>
    <li>The sixth bit is the “type-share” bit</li>
    <li>The seventh bit is the “type-ref” bit</li>
    <li>The eight bit remains unused</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="prefix-rules">Prefix rules</h4>
<p>The following rules give all valid combinations for the prefix bit:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The “null” bit excludes all other bits. If the null bit is set, all other set bits are invalid.</li>
    <li>The “ref” bit excludes all other bits. If the ref bit is set, all other set bits are invalid.</li>
    <li>The “ref” bit and the “share” bit are mutually exclusive. Only one or no of them may be set.</li>
    <li>The “untyped” bit forbids the “type-share” and the “type-ref” bits.</li>
    <li>The “type-share” and the “type-ref” are mutually exclusive. Only one or no of them may be set. As follows only
        the following combinations of bits are valid:
    </li>
    <li>null, no further information needs to be written.<br/>
    </li>
    <li>ref, after the header the following information is written:
        <ul>
            <li>the id which is used to reference the already shared structure</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>unshared and untyped, after the header the following information is written
        <ul>
            <li>The serialized fields of the structure</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>shared and untyped, after the header the following information is written
        <ul>
            <li>The id which will be used to reference the structure</li>
            <li>The serialized fields of the structure</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>unshared and class ref, after the header the following information is written</li>
    <li>unshared and type unshared, after the header the following information is written
        <ul>
            <li>The type of the structure</li>
            <li>The serialized fields of the structure</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>shared and class unshared, after the header the following information is written</li>
    <li>shared and class shared, after the header the following information is written</li>
    <li>shared and class ref, after the header the following information is written</li>
</ul>
